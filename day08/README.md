note:
for the 'ghost' quiz (part two) you do not want to traverse all the combinations until you get all ends with 'Z' because this will be an huge number or  tries!
Because every tracks end with Z with a period of steps, you need to find the minimum number of steps that ends with Z in each track and then find the least common multiple of its.
